week1 countinversions.py ------- use merge sort to count no. of inversions
week2 QuickSort.py --------- count comparisons in quick sort algorithm
week3 mincut.py ---------use random contraction algorihm to solve minimum cut.
week4 scc.py ---------- compute strong connected components for directed graph
week5 shortestpath.py --------- use Dijstra algorithm to compute shortest path for directed graph with non negtive edge.
week6 sum_2.py  ------- use sort and bsearch algorithm to compute sum2 problem
      median.py ------- use two heap(one min heap, one max heap) to compute run                         time median.
